          <p>Hey there! My name is Nick, and I'm a software developer living in Charleston, SC. My family and I just moved here, and we're excited to see what opportunity awaits!</p>

          <p>As a developer, I am interested in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Projects that reward and necessitate creativity</li>
            <li>Working in a collaborative environment that brings out the best in all involved</li>
            <li>Loving what I do!</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>About</h2>
          <p>I've spent the last several years touring the country as a guitar player for a national country act. I was fortunate enough to see amazing places, play amazing shows, and meet amazing people. Working with different peole in different places every week taught me a great deal about teamwork and resolution. Now, as a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I'm able to apply these skills, with my taste for the creative, to a new career in development. As a bonus, I get to have my amazing wife and beautiful 2-year-old daughter by my side as I embark on this newly beachside programming venture!</p>  

          <p>Please reach out for anything you might need. In the meantime, I look forward to working with other great developers to build robust projects, and really just great software!</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
          <p>While my portfolio of projects currently consists of a goose egg in terms of quantity right now, I am currently working toward a graduation from Thinkful's Coding Bootcamp. I trust that in my time at Thinkful, there will be a lot of projects to begin, and hopefully to complete, to showcase my work ethic and talents to a potential next employer! Until then, please allow to exemplify that I at least know <i>how</i> to present my projects to you in a clean and orderly fashion.</p>

              <h3>Guitar App</h3>
                <img class="item" src="images/comingsoon.jpg" alt="guitars"/>
                <p>I've always been a huge, huge fan of guitars and in my programming, I would like to develop a sort of guide, in its simplest forms, to the most iconic guitars, and who has played them. If you're a fan of Eric Clapton or Mark Knopfler, I'll point you to the Fender Stratocaster. Fan of Slash? The Gibson Les Paul, and so on. This would be a fun project for me, and hopefully an even more enjoyable clickthrough for anyone who takes a look!</p>

              <h3>Concert App</h3>
              <img class="item" src="images/comingsoon.jpg" alt="concertgoers"/>
              <p> Another thing that's always been a big thing for me is concerts. From live music to live comedy to live sports, you name it. It's fun and exciting, but there's always the headache of navigating a new town, a new venue, parking lots, things to do around the venue, etc. I'd like to develop a site that doesn't just connect you to the ticket booth, but also to the planning facilitator. A real one-stop shop!</p>
